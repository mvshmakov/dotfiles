# General usage tips:
# 1) To generate a log for some release, run:
# ```sh
# git shortlog commit_id...HEAD -n
# ```
# 2) While you can call these remotes anything you want, a common convention
# is to use origin as the remote for your forked repository (this will be
# created automatically when you run git clone) and upstream for the official repository.
